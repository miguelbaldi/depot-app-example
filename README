# I decided to put this sample application on Github just for learning purposes.
# This application is totally based on agile web development with rails book's.
# Feel free to use or modify this code, or even use that for support your studies.
#
# Added will_paginate support, so you must install will_paginate plugin or gem.
#
# For gem install, follow these steps (on a linux machine (debian-based)):
# shell>gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
# shell>sudo gem1.8 install mislav-will_paginate
